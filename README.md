# Online-Book-Store
Developed online bookstore which shows popular books for given words, user also can limit number of books he or she would like to see. Fetched the paragraph from server asynchronously using fetch GET HTTP API call and implemented responsiveness using different Bootstrap classes through mobile-first approach. Implemented user inputs of book words and limits by using html form elements input, select and maintain that data using JavaScript event listeners.
